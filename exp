* Inband: data is extracted using the same channel that is used to inject the SQL code. This is the moststraightforward kind of attack, 
    in which the retrieved data is presented directly in the application web page.
-> Error-based SQLi is an in-band SQL Injection technique that relies on error messages thrown by the database server to obtain 
    information about the structure of the database. In some cases, error-based SQL injection alone is enough for an attacker to enumerate an entire database.
    While errors are very useful during the development phase of a web application, they should be disabled on a live site, or logged to a file with restricted access instead.
-> Union-based SQLi is an in-band SQL injection technique that leverages the UNION SQL operator to combine the results of two or more SELECT statements into a single
    result which is then returned as part of the HTTP response.

* Inferential or Blind: there is no actual transfer of data, but the tester is able to reconstruct the information by sendingparticular requests 
    and observing the resulting behavior of the DB Server.
-> Boolean-based SQL Injection is an inferential SQL Injection technique that relies on sending an SQL query to the database which forces the application to return a different 
    result depending on whether the query returns a TRUE or FALSE result, Depending on the result, the content within the HTTP response will change,or remain the same.
-> Time-based SQL Injection is an inferential SQL Injection technique that relies on sending an SQL query to the database which forces the database to wait for a specified
    amount of time (in seconds) before responding. The response time will indicate to the attacker whether the result of the query is TRUE or FALSE, Depending on the result, 
    an HTTP response will be returned with a delay, or returned immediately.

Out-of-band: data is retrieved using a different channel (e.g., an email with the results of the query is generatedand sent to the tester).
