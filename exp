Inband: data is extracted using the same channel that is used to inject the SQL code. This is the moststraightforward kind of attack, 
in which the retrieved data is presented directly in the application web page.

Out-of-band: data is retrieved using a different channel (e.g., an email with the results of the query is generatedand sent to the tester).

Inferential or Blind: there is no actual transfer of data, but the tester is able to reconstruct the information by sendingparticular requests 
and observing the resulting behavior of the DB Server.
